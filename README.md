# File Sorter
Simple program that sorts files based on the file type. Primarily I created this to solve the problem of organization of my files in my downloads folder, but this code can work with any folder/directory that is provided in the prompt.
To use:
``` 
py sort_files.py 
```
Enter the directory that you would like to be sorted when prompted.
